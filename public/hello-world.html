		<hr />
		<p style="text-align:justify; margin:20px; font-size: 18px;">My name is <strong>Travis C. Flatt</strong>, and I am a student at <strong>Codeup</strong>.  I have worn a variety of hats prior to coming to Codeup.  I have over the years been a <em>Respiratory Therapist</em>, a <em>Prison Shop Supervisor</em>, a <em>Syndicated Humor Columnist</em>, a <em>Musician</em>, and an <em>Artist</em>.  I have apparently been trying to be <strong>Buckaroo Bonzai</strong>.<br /><br />I'm supposed to include a <strong>favorite quote</strong>... I don't really have one at any given moment, but for the purposes of this exercise, let's go with:</p>
		<blockquote style="border-radius:10px; background-color:#ddd; padding:10px;">Itâ€™s always a good idea to demonstrate to your coworkers that you're capable of withstanding a tremendous amount of pain.</blockquote><p style="text-align:justify; margin:20px; font-size: 18px;"><em>~Ron Swanson</em></p>
